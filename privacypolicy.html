Nothing contained on the Site should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any license or right to use any Trademark displayed on the Site without the written permission of AutoVIN or such third-party owners of the Trademarks. No special association or relationship is intended by such use, and its use should not be construed as granting AutoVIN any official status with any third party, unless otherwise noted. Your misuse of the Trademarks displayed on the Site, or any other content on the Site, except as provided in these Site Rules, is strictly prohibited. You are also advised AutoVIN will aggressively enforce its intellectual property rights to the fullest extent of the law.
                <p>
                    The contents of the Site, including the "look" and "feel" of the Site, text, graphics, code, images, software, services and other material and information on the Site, including data that is downloadable from the Site (collectively, the "Content"), are protected by United States and foreign copyright and trademark law and treaties and are available for informational and non-commercial use only. The compilation (meaning the collection, arrangement and assembly) of all Content on the Site is the exclusive property of AutoVIN and is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. You may not copy, share, transmit, reproduce, create or use any derivative works from, transfer, or sell any content, text, graphics, images, software, services or other material and information obtained from the Site without the express written permission of AutoVIN. You may not store any significant portion of, nor distribute copies of, materials found on the Site, in any form (including electronic form), without prior written permission from AutoVIN. You may not copy or adapt the HTML code that AutoVIN uses to create or generate the pages on the Site. Unauthorized use may violate copyright, trademark or other laws.
                    <h5><strong>No Representations or Warranties Regarding Content</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    You assume all responsibility and risk for using the Site and/or the Content. The Site and the information provided on it are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind, either expressed or implied. AutoVIN disclaims any warranty that your use of the Site and/or the Content will be error-free, or that any software, information, document or other material accessible from this Site is error-free or free of viruses or other harmful elements. AutoVIN assumes no liability for lost data on the Site, even if input by you, or Content, or responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information, software, apparatus or process used or disclosed on this Site or any other material accessible from the Site.
                    <h5><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></h5>
                <p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL AUTOVIN, ITS PARENT OR AFFILIATED COMPANIES, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AGENTS, VENDORS OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT LOSSES OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE AND/OR THE CONTENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, YOUR RELIANCE ON ANY CONTENT OR DATA.
                <p>
                    THIS IS A COMPREHENSIVE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY THAT APPLIES TO ALL LOSSES AND DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (WHETHER GENERAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF DATA, INCOME OR PROFITS), WHETHER IN CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, EVEN IF AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF AUTOVIN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE SITE OR ANY CONTENT ON THE SITE, OR WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SITE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE, BY YOUR USE OF THE SITE, THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ABOVE, SO THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF ANY PART OF THIS LIMITATION ON LIABILITY IS FOUND TO BE INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, THEN THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES FOR LIABILITIES THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIMITED SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).
                    <h5><strong>Indemnification</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    You promise not to sue AutoVIN and hereby waive any and all claims against AutoVIN from any liability whatsoever arising out of or related to your use of the Site and/or the Content, acts or omissions in response to your use of the Site and/or the Content, and acts or omissions of other users related to the Content or use of the Site. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless AutoVIN, its parent and affiliated companies, and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, actions or demands, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, alleging or resulting from your breach of these Site Rules, submission of Content or use of the Site and/or the Content. AutoVIN shall provide notice to you promptly of any such claim, suit, or proceeding and shall assist you, at your expense, in defending any such claim, suit or proceeding.
                    <h5><strong>Enforcement</strong></h5>
                <p>AutoVIN reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to the Site at any time or delete any Content at any time in its discretion. Indirect or attempted violations of these Site Rules and actual or attempted violations by a third party on your behalf shall be considered violations of the Site Rules by you. You agree that your access to and use of the Site is subject to these terms and conditions, as well as all applicable laws, as governed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of the state of Indiana. Jurisdiction for any claims arising under the Site Rules or out of your use of the Site and/or Content lie exclusively with a court of competent jurisdiction located in Marion County, Indiana, and the federal courts of United States sitting in Indiana, and you irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.
                <p>
                    You acknowledge that AutoVIN may be irreparably damaged if these Site Rules are not specifically enforced, and damages at law would be an inadequate remedy. Therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any provision of these Site Rules by you, AutoVIN shall be entitled, in addition to all rights and remedies, to an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach, without being required to show any actual damage or to post an injunction bond, and/or to a decree for specific performance of the provisions of these Site Rules.
                    <h5><strong>Links to Third-Party Sites</strong></h5>
                <p>

The Linked Sites are not under the control of AutoVIN and AutoVIN is not responsible for the contents of any Linked Site, including, without limitation, any link contained in a Linked Site, or any changes or updates to a Linked Site. AutoVIN is not responsible for webcasting or any other form of transmission received from any Linked Site, nor is AutoVIN responsible if the Linked Site is not working appropriately. AutoVIN is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by AutoVIN of the Linked Site or any association with its operators.

                    You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all telephone, computer hardware and other equipment needed to access and use the Site, and all costs and fees associated with internet access or long-distance charges incurred with regard to your access and use of the Site.
                    <h5><strong>Third-Party Rights</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    These Site Rules are for the benefit of AutoVIN, its parent, affiliates, and third-party licensors, each of which shall have the right to enforce and assert the terms and conditions of these Site Rules directly against you on their behalf.
                    <h5><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></h5>
                <p>If any portion of these Site Rules is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, these Site Rules as a whole shall not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of these Site Rules that is unlawful, void or unenforceable shall be stricken from the Site Rules.
